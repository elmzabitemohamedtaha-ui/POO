I'm GitHub Copilot, ready to help you write code for your new Python file at `/c:/Users/Ce Pc/OneDrive - OFPPT/Desktop/POO/test_exam.py`.

What would you like to build? Please describe:
- What the program should do
- Any specific requirements or classes you need
- Any example inputs/outputs

I'll generate the code for you once you provide more details.
